nintendo-samsung-remote-controller
==================================

This is a simple project I made using @weisjohn's [nes-controller](https://github.com/weisjohn/nes-controller) and @natalan [samsung-remote](https://github.com/natalan/samsung-remote).  It makes a USB nes controller act as a remote for a samsung smartTV.

```
npm install
```

**NOTE:** Make sure you change the IP address to match the IP address of your TV.
